About Me⚙️

Hello there! 👋 I'm a graduate of BS Information Technology last 2019. Currently working in the Accounting Department at 711 Corporation, where I'm gaining invaluable real-world experience. 
Despite my initial lack of technical experience, especially in Web development, I'm on a relentless journey of self-improvement, constantly learning and exploring various technologies to stay ahead of the curve.

For the past year and continuing into the present, I've dedicated a minimum of 2 hours every night to dive deep into programming. Alongside my studies, I'm also actively working on personal projects, with plans to delve into freelancing soon to further hone my skills.

My true passion lies in crafting unique experiences on the web. I thrive on collaboration and am always eager to learn from and contribute to the programming community. Let's unite our efforts, enhance our skills, and create amazing things together! 🚀🌐.
